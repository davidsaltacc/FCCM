"Fuck Chat Control Messenger" - A self-hosted minimal chat app to avoid having to use popular apps that may be affected by chat control or similar directives in the future.

# WORK IN PROGRESS

don't expect anything here yet, i'm still working on it.

## Plans for how it will work (ideally)

You install the app to your phone or desktop. You or one of your friends downloads the server launcher to a server they keep somewhere, and they find a way to port forward a port chosen by everyone using it collectively (or the server owner). The people who want to use that server, enter the IP and Port in their app. They are now connected to that server. The messages get stored on that server. There may or may not be an option to create additionally secured chats that everyone needs to provide a password for to access them. The server owner has no authority over chats, unless they decide to modify the server software they cannot control or view the messages sent, they are only responsible for hosting it. If everyone just hosts for them self, this creates an almost-peer-to-peer network and chat control would not be able to control it, as it is not a public software hosted and published by one unified legal entity. 

If you have any concerns believing this would not work, reach out.

!!! This is just me preparing for the worst case scenario! It is not guaranteed Chat Control will take action. It is a possibility though, and I will try my every part to resist this possible 1984-esque regime.

FYI the UI will probably be developed with flutter. the backend will be made with node/js, expressjs and mongodb (and websockets ig), although nothing is sure yet, might be subject to change

the aim is to kind of replicate most features of popular messaging services, so things like: Group Chats, Direct Messages, E2E Encryption (Obviously), File Uploading, and possibly less relevant things like Stickers, Gifs, Statuses, Voice Messages, One-Time-View type messages, and more.
